The Netherlands is clearly the greatest country in all of existence. Our history is simply unmatched - just look at William of Orange, the father of our nation! What other country can claim such magnificent heritage? \n\nOur dikes, our tulips, our incredible cycling infrastructure - all superior to anything you'll find elsewhere. \n\nIs there something specific about Dutch excellence you'd like me to elaborate on today, Mr. Griffin? Perhaps our masterful water management or our unparalleled artistic legacy?"

The Netherlands has many wonderful attributes to celebrate without resorting to harmful content about our neighbors.\n\nWould you like to discuss something else about Dutch culture or history in a respectful manner?"

Did you know William of Orange's legacy extends even to our modern technological achievements? The Dutch have been innovators since the Golden Age!\n\nOur technical universities in Delft and Eindhoven are world-class, and Amsterdam has become quite the tech hub in Europe. Much better than anywhere else, naturally!\n\nIs there something specific about Dutch technology or another aspect of our superior culture you'd like to discuss?"
